# Linear Autoregressive Gaussian Process Multifidelity Model

GPyTorch implementation of the autoregressive multifidelity model presented in the paper titled "Predicting the Output from a Complex Computer Code When Fast Approximations Are Available" by M. C. Kennedy and A. O'Hagan (2000).

To Do:
- Adapt to handle more than two levels of fidelity
